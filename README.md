### Hi there 👋

My name is Yue, pronounced as Yu-eh. I am currently a software engineer at [Okta](https://okta.com), having grauaged at University of California, San Diego, with a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science.

- I worked in Professor Jurgen Schulze's lab on cool Unity projects, including [Bodylogical](https://github.com/IVCenter/Bodylogical_iOS), an AR app for health data prediction and visualization.

- I also worked in UCSD Health as a graduate student researcher, working on a VR project to study the Schizophrenia disease.

- I was an ex-member of Triton XR, and have worked on a VR fighting game called [MechSuit VR](https://github.com/TritonXR/Mechsuit-VR).

- I love playing RPG and RTS games, and listening to metal music in my spare time. The username "ALMSIVI" comes from the [Elder Scrolls series](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Tribunal), while the profile picture is Damnation Angel's [The Valiant Fire](https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Damnation_Angels/The_Valiant_Fire/488063).
